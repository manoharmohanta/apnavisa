                    <p class="mb-5 text-justify">This is a non-immigrant visa for individuals traveling to the United States temporarily
                        for business purposes. It allows holders to engage in activities such as attending business
                        meetings, conferences, negotiations, or other professional events. B1 visa holders are not
                        permitted to work or receive any form of compensation from a U.S. source during their stay.</p>
                    <h3 class="heading-2 text-primary mb-3">B2 Visa</h3>
                    <p class="mb-5 text-justify">This is a non-immigrant visa for individuals traveling to the United States temporarily
                        for tourism, pleasure, or visiting friends and relatives. It allows holders to engage in activities
                        such as tourism, vacation, social visits, amateur participation in musical, sports, or similar
                        events, and medical treatment. Like the B1 visa, B2 visa holders are not allowed to work in the
                        United States.
                        </p>
                    <p class="mb-5 text-justify">The B1 and B2 visas are often issued together as a B1/B2 visa, allowing holders to engage in
                        both business and tourist activities during their stay in the U.S. The duration of stay granted
                        with a B1/B2 visa can vary, but it's typically limited to a maximum of six months per visit.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5 text-justify">It's essential to note that while these visas allow entry into the United States for temporary
                    purposes, they do not grant the holder the right to live or work in the country permanently.
                    Additionally, obtaining a B1/B2 visa requires applicants to demonstrate strong ties to their
                    home country, such as stable employment, family, and financial assets, to prove their intent to
                    return after their temporary stay in the United States.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-12" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
                    <p class="mb-5 text-justify">The duration of a B1/B2 visa for the United States varies depending on several factors,
                        including the discretion of the consular officer issuing the visa and the purpose of the visit.
                        Here are some key points regarding the duration:
                        </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li><p class="mb-5 text-justify">Validity Period: The validity period of a B1/B2 visa is typically determined by the
                        consular officer and can vary from a few months to up to ten years. During this validity
                        period, the visa holder can enter the United States multiple times, as long as the visa
                        remains valid and the purpose of each visit aligns with the visa category (business,
                        tourism, or both).</p></li> 
                        <li><p class="mb-5 text-justify">Duration of Each Stay: While the visa itself may be valid for a more extended period,
                            the duration of each stay in the United States is typically limited to a maximum of six
                            months. However, the specific length of stay granted is determined by the U.S. Customs
                            and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the port of entry. They have the authority to
                            admit visitors for a shorter period, depending on the purpose of the visit and other
                            factors.</p></li> 
                        <li><p class="mb-5 text-justify">Extension of Stay: In some cases, individuals in the United States on a B1/B2 visa may
                            be eligible to apply for an extension of their stay if they have a valid reason, such as
                            medical treatment or unforeseen circumstances preventing their departure. However,
                            extensions are granted at the discretion of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
                            Services (USCIS) and are not guaranteed.
                            </p></li>
                        <li><p class="mb-5 text-justify">Dual Intent: It's important to note that while the B1/B2 visa is primarily for temporary
                            visits, individuals can still have dual intent, meaning they may intend to visit
                            temporarily while also having an underlying intent to immigrate to the United States
                            in the future. However, they must be able to demonstrate their intent to return to their
                            home country at the end of each visit to comply with the terms of the visa.
                            </p></li>
