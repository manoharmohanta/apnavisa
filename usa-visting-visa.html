                    <!-- <p class="mb-2 text-justify">The duration of a B1/B2 visa for the United States varies depending on several factors,
                        including the discretion of the consular officer issuing the visa and the purpose of the visit.
                        Here are some key points regarding the duration:
                        </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p class="mb-2 text-justify">Validity Period: The validity period of a B1/B2 visa is typically determined by the
                            consular officer and can vary from a few months to up to ten years. During this validity
                            period, the visa holder can enter the United States multiple times, as long as the visa
                            remains valid and the purpose of each visit aligns with the visa category (business,
                            tourism, or both).</p></li> 
                        <li><p class="mb-2 text-justify">Duration of Each Stay: While the visa itself may be valid for a more extended period,
                            the duration of each stay in the United States is typically limited to a maximum of six
                            months. However, the specific length of stay granted is determined by the U.S. Customs
                            and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the port of entry. They have the authority to
                            admit visitors for a shorter period, depending on the purpose of the visit and other
                            factors.</p></li> 
                        <li><p class="mb-2 text-justify">Extension of Stay: In some cases, individuals in the United States on a B1/B2 visa may
                            be eligible to apply for an extension of their stay if they have a valid reason, such as
                            medical treatment or unforeseen circumstances preventing their departure. However,
                            extensions are granted at the discretion of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
                            Services (USCIS) and are not guaranteed.
                            </p></li>
                        <li><p class="mb-2 text-justify">Dual Intent: It's important to note that while the B1/B2 visa is primarily for temporary
                            visits, individuals can still have dual intent, meaning they may intend to visit
                            temporarily while also having an underlying intent to immigrate to the United States
                            in the future. However, they must be able to demonstrate their intent to return to their
                            home country at the end of each visit to comply with the terms of the visa.
